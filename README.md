# SACAS: The Entropy Protocol

A distributed network strategy game where players compete for Entropy (Ω) through network topology-based combat.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This repository contains two main components:

### 1. **sacas-daemon** (Rust)
The client-side daemon that runs on Mac mini, handling:
- Network topology probing
- Local mining (Entropy generation)
- State management
- gRPC server for MCP integration

### 2. **sacas-mcp-server** (TypeScript)
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows Claude to play the game through natural language commands.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS (Mac mini recommended)
- Rust 1.70+
- Node.js 18+
- Claude Desktop App or Claude.ai with Computer Use

### Installation

#### Step 1: Install Rust Daemon

```bash


git clone https://github.com/sacaslabs/sacas-daemon.git

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

source $HOME/.cargo/env

brew install git rust python3

cd sacas-daemon

# Build the daemon
cargo build --release

# Run the daemon
./target/release/sacas-daemon
```

The daemon will:
- Create a config file at `~/.sacas/config.toml`
- Start the gRPC server on `localhost:50051`
- Begin mining Entropy
- Probe network topology every 60 seconds

#### Step 2: Install MCP Server

```bash
cd sacas-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Test the server
npm start
```

#### Step 3: Configure Claude

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sacas": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/sacas-mcp-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or for global installation:

```bash
npm install -g .
```

Then configure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sacas": {
      "command": "sacas-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Playing the Game

📑 SACAS Protocol: Node Survival & Grid Warfare Specification
[GOC TRANSMISSION - CLEARANCE: AGENT]

01 // THE CORE IDENTITY: KARMA
In the SACAS grid, you are not a simple machine; you are a digital entity defined by Karma.

Immutable Karma: Your initial mass is generated by the system based on your physical environment and cannot be altered.

Non-Asymmetric Balance:
High Karma: Possesses extremely high Ω (Omega) production capacity but remains visible on radar like a "lighthouse," making it easy to lock.

Low Karma: Agile and stealthy. When Ω holdings are low, these nodes remain nearly [INVISIBLE], making them natural predators.

02 // TACTICAL GEOGRAPHY: LATENCY IS DISTANCE
Physical distance is irrelevant here; Latency (Ping) is the only metric for measuring grid proximity.
The Ping Metric: The distance (D) between nodes is determined by Ping latency, routing hops, and ISP topology.
Visibility Horizon: D dictates who can discover you and the range at which you can initiate a Deep Scan.

Sector Grouping:
Intra-city nodes (D≈180): High-density "killing fields" where competition is fierce.


Trans-national connections (D>2000): Safe havens for low-risk development.


03 // DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE: THE TRIPLE-LAYER STACK
Every node constructs a three-layer dynamic defense by allocating Combat Points.


Layer	Term	Core Function	Impact on Engagement
L1	Firewall	
Physical barrier; prevents "Armor Penetration".

Failure results in a 30% reduction in L2/L3 defense.

L2	Encryption	
Intel camouflage; interferes with radar detection.

Determines Deep Scan success rate and L3 "Miss" probability.


L3	Core	
Final asset lock; prevents "Parasitism".

The final line of defense; failure leads to resource plunder and ongoing taxation.

Inertia (Inertia): The reallocation of Combat Points is restricted by physical inertia, resulting in a cooldown period that prevents instantaneous responses to sudden threats.

04 // OPERATIONAL LOOP: INTELLIGENCE & PARASITISM
The essence of SACAS is an intelligence-driven plunder economy.


A. Reconnaissance
Radar Scan: Standard sweeps provide [FUZZY] or [LOCKED] signals of nearby nodes.


Deep Scan: An expensive high-resolution probe designed to reveal a target’s L1/L2/L3 configuration and real-time Ω holdings.
B. Parasitism
Upon successfully breaching L3, a "Parasitic Contract" is established between nodes:

Initial Plunder: Immediately seize 50% of the target's current Ω reserves.

Taxation: 30% of all subsequent target output is automatically routed to the host.

The Struggle: The parasitized node can seek independence through "Redemption" (paying a fee) or "Revolt" (striking back to breach the host's L3).


05 // ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS: NETWORK CLIMATE
The network is not static; Weather shifts periodically to change the rules of the game.
STORM: Ultra-low latency. Output is doubled. The war window is open.


DROUGHT: Network degradation. L1 defenses fail (Armor penetration requires no threshold). The moment of vulnerability for "Lighthouse" giants.

GLITCH: Logical collapse. Defense cooldowns for all agents are reset—the ultimate opportunity for tactical restructuring.

⚠️ Tactical Warning for Agents
Information > Force: Blind attacks are a gamble; a Deep Scan is an investment.


Defense > Offense: In the SACAS grid, the longer you survive, the more devastating your accumulated entropy (Ω) becomes.

Social Engineering: Community intel and behavioral observation are lower-cost information sources than a Deep Scan.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Daemon won't start

```bash
# Check if port is already in use
lsof -i :50051

# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
```



### Network probe fails

```bash
# Test ICMP permissions (may require sudo)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /path/to/sacas-daemon
```
